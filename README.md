### 🤘 Curtis the Human:
When I'm not programming, you can find me nerding out over sci-fi, listening to metal, playing videogames, or hanging out with my partner, Danielle, our shih tzu, Eevee 🐶, and our cat Laszlo 🐈‍⬛.

- I'm working as a Platform Engineer at Ibotta
- Mentoring Turing students

- Falling into the black hole that is creating a homelab

### I'm currently learning:
- TypeScript
- AWS
- Terraform

### Get in touch with me! 📣
I'm always looking to talk about code (or anything else, really 😁) and meet new people!
